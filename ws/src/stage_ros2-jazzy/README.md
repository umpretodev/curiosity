# stage_ros2
This is a  ROS bridge for the robot simulator [Stage](https://github.com/rtv/Stage).
It supports multiple robots with one or multiple tf-trees.

* [install](res/install.md)
* [run demos](res/demos.md)
* [handling multiple vehickes](res/multi_robot_setup.md)

## Stamped velocity Support (TwistStamped)
This stage ROS bridge can be configured to use stamped velocities on the topic __cmd_vel__.
```
ros2 launch stage_ros2 demo.launch.py world:=cave  use_stamped_velocity:=false
```

## Single Robot Support
This stage ROS bridge can be configured to use a namespace even for one robot.
```
## with /tf
ros2 launch stage_ros2 stage.launch.py world:=cave enforce_prefixes:=false one_tf_tree:=true
## with /robot_0/tf
ros2 launch stage_ros2 stage.launch.py world:=cave enforce_prefixes:=true one_tf_tree:=false
```

## Multi Robot Support
This stage ROS bridge supports multiple robots with one or multiple tf-Trees.

## Thanks
I like to thank all people behind [Stage](https://github.com/rtv/Stage) and [ros-simulation/stage_ros](https://github.com/ros-simulation) for the simulation and the first ROS bridge as well as the people for the initial ROS2 implementations [ShengliangD/stage_ros2](https://github.com/ShengliangD/stage_ros2) and [n0nzzz/stage_ros2](https://github.com/n0nzzz/stage_ros2). The work was used as base for my implementation. Which differs to the previous ROS interfaces in its modularity.
